# My sort illustration

Personal project for mastering sorting algorithms. 
A command line application that demonstrates various sorting algorithms 
by allowing the user to guess the next step of the algorithm.





## Features

- Uses [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for the cli
- Demonstration of the process by guessing the next changed step (version) of the sorting algorithm
- Utilizes common interface for controlling the step by step execution of the algorithm
- Sorting algorithms are unit tested


## Notes
Some code of the sorting algorithms were taken from [this website](https://www.tutorialdocs.com/article/golang-sort-algorithms.html).
